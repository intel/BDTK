Intel Codec Library Module Introduction
==========================================

Module descritption
-------------------------

Intel Codec Library provides compression and decompression library for Apache Hadoop/Spark to make use of the acceleration hardware for compression/decompression. It not only can leverage QAT/IAA hardware to accelerate deflate-compatible data compression algorithms but also supports the use of Intel software optimized solutions such as Intel ISA-L(Intel Intelligent Storage Acceleration Library and IPP(Intel Integrated Performance Primitives Library) to accelerate the data compression.
